Hey there! Here's a bunch of stuff that needs done:

## TODO

- [ ] Add a DNS system.

- [ ] ZFS (WIP)

- [ ] Documentation: Lots of docs are needed. Libredox and common are documented.
      It's all documented however it's not well documented. Many of the docs are
      extremely short and poorly explain.

- [ ] Port toml-rs to redox

- [ ] Add the multithreading functionality that the std provides.

- [ ] Remove the uses of `return` statements.


Add more stuff if you want.
